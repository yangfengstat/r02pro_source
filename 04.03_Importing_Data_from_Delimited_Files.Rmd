## Importing Data from Delimited Files {#import-data}

Knowing how to export data into delimited files, let us now see how to **import** data from delimited files.

### Import .csv Files using `read_csv()`

To import .csv files, we can use the function `read_csv()` in the **readr** package, which is a sub-package of **tidyverse**. If you have already installed **tidyverse**, you can directly load the **readr** package.

After loading the **readr** package, you can try to import the data from "gm_small.csv" which we created in Section \@ref(write-csv). Please make sure the .csv file is located in the folder "data" relative to the current working directory. Otherwise, you need to change the working directory accordingly using the methods introduced in Section \@ref(setwd).

<!-- ```{r echo = FALSE} -->

<!-- knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "data") -->

<!-- ``` -->

```{r}
library(readr)
gm_small <- read_csv("data/gm_small.csv")
```

We can see that there is a message showing the **Column specification** during the import process. In particular, we see `country` is of type *character*, and both `year` and `HDI` are of type *double*. We can also check the value of `gm_small` and its structure.

```{r, results=TRUE}
gm_small
str(gm_small)
```

We can see that the tibble `gm_small` is generated along with the correct column types. In order to introduce the various options associated with `read_csv()` function, let's move on to the topic of **inline** .csv files next.

### Read Inline .csv Files

The `read_csv()` function not only can read files into R, it also accept **inline input** as its argument. While the inline input may not be commonly used in practice, it is particularly useful for learning how to use the function, and be able to handle various importing cases when dealing with real life datasets. Let's see an example.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
read_csv("x,y,z
          1,3,5
          2,4,6")
```

This inline input example is equivalent to reading a .csv file with contents identical to those in quotes. You can see that a tibble with size of 2 by 3 is generated with the column names being `x`, `y` and `z`. From the argument, we can see that by default, the **first row** of the input data will be interpreted as the column names.

***a. No column names***

If the first row of the input data doesn't correspond to the variable names, you need to set `col_names = FALSE` as an additional argument in `read_csv()`.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
read_csv("x,y,z
          1,3,5
          2,4,6", col_names = FALSE)
```

Now, a tibble of 3 rows and 3 columns was generated, with the column names being `X1`, `X2`, and `X3`. Note that these are the default naming conventions in the function when you don't supply the column names in the file. Another thing worth mentioning is that all three variables are of **character** types, due to the fact that there are character values for all variables ("x", "y", and "z").

***b. Skip the first few lines***

Sometimes, the first few lines of your data file may be descriptions of the data, which you want to skip when importing into R. We can set the `skip` argument in the `read_csv()` function to skip a certain number of lines.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
read_csv("The first line 
          The second line
          The third line
          x,y,z
          1,3,5", skip = 3)
```

It is clear from the result that the first 3 lines of the input data are skipped.

***c. Skip the comments***

Another useful argument in cases when we have comments in the data file is the `comment` argument, which tells R to skip all text after the string specified in the `comment` argument.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
read_csv("x,y,z #variable names
         1,3,5 #the first observation
         2,4,6 #the second observation", comment = "#")
```

### Handling Missing Values

In many real data sets, we may have missing values. You may recall that R uses `NA` to represent the missing values. If the data set was prepared by an R user, it probably already uses `NA` to represent all missing values. In this case, life is easy since `read_csv()` will automatically interpret all `NA`s as missing values.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
read_csv("x,y,z
          999,3,5
         NA,-999,6")
```

In a typical application, however, the person who prepared the data may use other strings to represent missing values. For example, if 999 and -999 are used as the indicators for missing values, you can set the argument `na` to be the vector containing those values. Note that `NA` will still be interpreted as missing values automatically.

```{r, results=TRUE}
read_csv("x,y,z
          999,3, yes
         NA,-999, no
         12, 12, NA", na = c("999","-999"))
```

You can see from the output tibble that all the missing values are now denoted as `NA`.

::: {.infobox .caution data-latex="{caution}"} Note that the quotation marks around 999 and -999 are necessary since the `na` argument is expecting a character vector.

```{r, error=TRUE}
read_csv("x,y,z
          999,3,5
         999,-999,6", na = c(999,-999))
```

You can see an error message, stating that it is expecting character values, but got double values.

### Importing Data From a Delimited File

You now know how to import data from a .csv file using the `read_csv()` function. More generally, `read_delim()` allows us to import data from a delimited file with any chosen *delimiter*. The usage of `read_delim()` is almost identical to `read_csv()`, except that it has an additional argument `delim`, which specifies the delimiter to be used. Let's see the following example with `*` as the delimiter. Note that we are using the "my_animals_star.csv" file generated in Section \@ref(write-delim).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_animals <- read_delim("data/gm_small_star.csv", delim = "*")
```

Let's try to use `read_csv()` instead to check what will you get.

```{r}
read_csv("data/gm_small_star.csv")
```

You will see that the imported data has only one variable named `country*year*HDI` since the function will interpret the whole thing as a single variable.

### Import Data Using the Menu {#import-menu}

Besides writing codes involving `read_csv()` or `read_delim()` to import data, you can also take advantage of the interactive menu RStudio provides.

To do this, you can click on the **Import Dataset** button in the **Environment** panel on the top right of RStudio shown in the following figure.

```{r, results = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Import Dataset Menu", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/5-import.png")
```

Here, you can see quite a few options which are summarized in the following table.

```{r importMenu, echo = FALSE, results = TRUE}
Choice  <- c("From Text (readr)","From Excel","From SPSS","From SAS","From Stata")
Name <- c("Delimited Files (.csv, .txt, and others)", "Excel Files (.xls and .xlsx)", "SPSS Files (.sav)", "SAS Files (.sas7bdat and.sas7bcat)","Stata Files (.dta)")
d <- data.frame(Choice, Name)
knitr::kable(d, caption = "Import Data from Menu")
```

We have been focusing on importing delimited files in this section. We will cover importing Excel files in Section \@ref(import-excel). Working with SPSS, SAS, and Stata files will be covered in Section \@ref(import-other).

For importing a .csv file, .txt file, or any other file with a delimiter, you can choose the **From Text (readr)** option. Then, you can click **Browse...** and select the data file. We will select the "gm_small_star.csv" file in the "data" folder.

After a file is selected, you can see the **Data Preview** which is showing the first several rows of the data. Note that the first row shows the column names and their associate types in parentheses. For each column, you can click the drop-down menu after the type to change its type.

```{r, results = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Import Data Preview", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/5-import-preview-star.png")
```

From this figure, you can see that the preview only shows one column named "country\*year\*HDI". Apparently, the separator "\*" is not properly interpreted during the process.

To fix this problem, we can look at the **Import Options** in the left area.

```{r, results = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Import Options", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/5-import-options.png")
```

Let's summarize a few commonly used options, their corresponding arguments in the `read_csv()` or `read_delim()` function, and meanings.

```{r importOptions, echo = FALSE, results = TRUE}
Option  <- c("Name","Skip","First Row as Names","Delimiter","Comment","NA","Code Preview")
Argument <- c("-", "`skip`", "`col_names`", "`delim`", "`comment`","`na`","-")
Meaning <- c("The object name you would like to assign to.", "The number of rows to skip at the beginning of the file.", "Whether you want to use the first row as column names. `TRUE` or `FALSE`.", "The delimiter of the data file. ","The character indicating the starting of comment. The contents after the comment character will be ignore in each line.", "The way NA is represented in the data file.", "The R code to be executed for importing the data")
d <- data.frame(Option, Argument, Meaning)
knitr::kable(d, caption = "Menu Options and its Corresponding Arguments in `read_delim()` and Meanings")
```

In our case, we will change the value of "Delimiter" to "\*" (Note that you need to select "Other..", and enter "\*" manually.)

```{r, results = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Import Options (Star)", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/5-import-options-star.png")
```

Note that when you change the delimiter, the **Data Preview** window also change correspondingly.

```{r, results = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Data Preview (Star)", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/5-import-preview-star-correct.png")
```

After changing the delimiter to `*`, we are seeing the expected data with three columns: `dig_num`, `ani_char`, and `conditions`.

The code in the *Code Preview* window will change accordingly, which is a great way to learn on how they work. The new codes in the *Code Preview* window is as below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readr)
gm_small_star <- read_delim("data/gm_small_star.csv", 
                            delim = "*", 
                            escape_double = FALSE, 
                            trim_ws = TRUE)
View(gm_small_star)
```

### Exercises

1.  For the "my_data_na.csv" file you created in Exercise 2 in Section \@ref(export-data), write R code to read the file into an object with name `my_data`.

2.  First, look at the code below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
d1 <- read_csv("x,y,z
          1,3,5
          2,4,6", col_names = FALSE)
```

Which of the following are the column names of the `d1`?

-   `X1`, `X2`, and `X3`
-   `x`, `y`, and `z`

3.  First, look at the code below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
d1 <- read_csv("The first line 
          The second line
          The third line
          x,y,z
          1,3,5")
```

What will be the column name(s) of the `d1`?
